Welcome to Railed, a Ruby On Rails boilerplate project designed for production use. This boilerplate comes pre-configured with Nginx, HTTP/2, and QUIC (HTTP/3) support to ensure optimal performance and security. Additionally, Railed contains a carefully curated list of pre-installed must-have Rails gems, streamlining the development process for building robust and feature-rich applications.

For exact list of ruby gems installed please check `Gemfile`.


## Features ‚ú®:

* ***Nginx with HTTP/2 and QUIC Support***: Industry-standard web server known for its high performance, stability, and efficient handling of static and dynamic content. Take advantage of HTTP/2 for faster communication and embrace the future of the web with QUIC, a next-generation transport layer protocol designed to enhance speed and security.

* ***Docker and Docker-Compose***: Easily manage and deploy your application using Docker containers, with a separate docker-compose.yml file for each environment (development, testing, and production).

* ***Stimulus and Turbo***: Leverage the power of Stimulus for lightweight and modern JavaScript controllers, and Turbo to enhance the user experience by enabling seamless, fast navigation between pages.

* ***Tailwind CSS with Flowbite UI Components***: Utilize the flexibility and utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS, along with the Flowbite UI components, to expedite the styling process and ensure a modern, responsive design.

# Setting things up üõ†Ô∏è
You don't have to touch `Dockerfile` because all system libraries for gems are already installed unless you added some gems that requires install some system c libs or something.

### Setting up application

1. Generate new `master key` by simply running `bin/rails runner 'puts ActiveSupport::EncryptedFile.generate_key` and put this key into `.env`.
2. Fill up things in `credentials.yml.enc` like in `config/credentials.yml.example`
3. Open `.env` and fill rest of the things expect `DATABASE_HOST` and `REDIS_HOST` unless you know what you're doing.

### Setting up database

1. Open `init.sql` and fill the init script with user and password that you will refer later in you application. TODO: read `.env` in `init.sql` to keep everything in `.env`

After that your app should run without any problems. If you experience any problems with this boilerplate please open an issue and describe everything, I'll try to help you out!

### Nginx Configuration:
The Nginx configuration files are located in the `./proxy` directory. Adjust the settings according to your production environment. Replace the default localhost.crt and private.key files with your own SSL/TLS certificate and private key.

### Run application

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

### Run tests in development env
```sh
docker-compose exec -e RAILS_ENV=test app bin/rspec
```
